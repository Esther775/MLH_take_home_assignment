Run rails db:create rail: db:migrate rails:seed to create your database, schema file, and seed the GitHub REST-api data.

In the requests.http file, the first endpoint allows a user to include a project_id as a url parameter and will show the user data contributions to that project.

A second endpoint allows a user to enter two body params to locate a users activity on a specific project.
